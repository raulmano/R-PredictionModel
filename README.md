# R-PredictionModel

There are 2 prediction mdodels here both written in R.

- Binary (Churn or No-churn) with candiddate models Logistic Regression, Random Foret and CV deciion trees
- Multinomial (Full time employed, part-tme, not-looking and voluntary unemplotyment) with XGBoost as model

Both cases used correlation, Pearsopn for the former and Kendall for he latter, for feature selection.
As the results are sensitive, only the R codes are published and generated charts and ran log files are excluded.
